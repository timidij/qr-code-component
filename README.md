## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This page was designed using just HTML and CSS,
created, different div class to make styling with css easir. I also made use of flex property to make the page responsive to different screen size. I also learnt how to import fonts for CSS

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:



### Continued development

I noticed that as the screen size got ver small one of the margin on main div disappeared... I still have to correct that.
